# Intro

This repo is an internal assignment I had once with an ex employer. At the time I didn't have a good understanding so I 
decided to take another crack at it. This is a micro service architecture involving a Spring Boot services and Kafka. 
There are mainly three modules: Producer, Consumer and Service. The Producer and Consumer module involve Kafka in which 
one send an events and the other one listen to it. The Service module is a REST API.
